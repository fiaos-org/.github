## overview
The Umbrella Project is a vision for sustainable living, scientific discovery, and autonomous technology. Built as a 10 cm module, it transforms rainfall, humidity, temperature, and evapotranspiration into over 100 distinct input parameters. From these, it can derive more than one million real data points, enabling scientists, farmers, and innovators to test algorithms, validate research, and explore the relationship between environment and life.

Version 1.0 is just the beginning. Designed for interoperability, it works across platforms including iOS, Windows, web applications, and services such as IFTTT. Its communication range extends up to five kilometers, allowing remote connectivity and collaboration in fields ranging from agriculture and biology to climate science and geography.

## imagine
Imagine a system that not only irrigates plants but also delivers nutrients through integrated liquid fertilizer control. Imagine a self-sustaining device that can operate for ten years without intervention, collecting, processing, and sharing data across scientific networks. Imagine a living organism, a plant, a fungus, even an experimental biological model, thriving under its protection in extreme weather when no water remains elsewhere.

The Umbrella Project embodies resilience and innovation. It is not just a tool but a companion for researchers, a safeguard for life, and a new foundation for sustainable ecosystems.
